# SASS Installation Steps

## Prerequisites Check
1. Check if Node.js is installed:
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
   Output: v24.3.0

2. Check if npm is installed:
   ```bash
   npm --version
   ```
   Output: 11.4.2

## SASS Installation
3. Install SASS globally using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g sass@3.7.4
   ```

## Alternative Installation (if Node.js not installed)
If Node.js was not installed, these would be the steps:

1. Install Node.js version 20.16 using nvm:
   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. Exit terminal and reopen it, then install Node.js:
   ```bash
   nvm install 20.16
   nvm use 20.16
   ```

3. Then install SASS:
   ```bash
   npm install -g sass@3.7.4
   ```

## Verification
4. Verify SASS installation:
   ```bash
   sass --version
   ```

## Notes
- Node.js was already installed (v24.3.0) so we skipped the nvm installation
- npm was already available (v11.4.2)
- SASS installation is global using the -g flag
- Version 3.7.4 is specified as per requirements
